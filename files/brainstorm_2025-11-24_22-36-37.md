# Ultrathink: Personal AI Orchestration Layer
## Refined Brainstorm & Architecture

---

## The Real Problem

You don't have an AI problem. You have a **state management problem**.

- You have endless powerful AI tools at your fingertips
- You generate ideas faster than you can ship
- Everything lives in "tab limbo" - half-baked, unfinished
- No forcing function to push ideas → shipped artifacts
- No single source of truth for "what am I actually working on"

**You don't need another AI agent. You need a state machine with teeth.**

---

## What The Other AI Got Right

The "factory" concept is solid:

✅ **Inbox for capturing everything** - No more lost tabs
✅ **Pipelines for different output types** - Content, code, research
✅ **Publishing to real destinations** - LinkedIn, blog, Render
✅ **Forcing completion** - Rules engine to prevent infinite WIP
✅ **Review/accountability** - Weekly forcing functions

These are the right primitives.

---

## What The Other AI Over-Engineered

❌ **Too many custom AI agents** - You already have AI tools. Don't rebuild them.
❌ **Complex multi-agent coordination** - Over-architected for MVP.
❌ **Rigid pipeline templates** - You need flexibility, not prescriptive flows.
❌ **Too much automation** - You want orchestration, not a black box.

The proposal treats Ultrathink like a startup product. You need a **personal power tool**.

---

## The Refined Vision: Ultrathink as "Git for Ideas"

Think of Ultrathink as **version control + CI/CD for your creative output**.

### Core Concept

Every idea is a **Project** that moves through states:

```
CAPTURED → SCOPED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → SHIPPED → LIVE
```

Ultrathink's job:
1. **Track state** of every project
2. **Enforce constraints** (max 3 active, minimum 1 shipped/week)
3. **Provide interfaces** to capture, work on, and ship
4. **Integrate with your tools** (not replace them)
5. **Publish to multiple destinations** with adapters

You stay in control. The system forces progress.

---

## Architecture: Simple, Modular, Extensible

### 1. Core: Project State Machine

**Data Model:**

```typescript
Project {
  id: string
  title: string
  capturedAt: timestamp

  // Classification
  type: 'content' | 'code' | 'research' | 'experiment'
  tags: string[]

  // Prioritization
  impactScore: 1-5
  effortScore: 'hours' | 'days' | 'weeks'
  priority: number (auto-calculated)

  // State
  status: 'captured' | 'scoped' | 'active' | 'review' | 'shipped' | 'live' | 'archived'

  // Content
  originalCapture: string (url, note, whatever)
  brief: string (what is this, why ship it)
  artifacts: Artifact[] (drafts, code, research docs)

  // Publishing
  publishTargets: ('linkedin' | 'blog' | 'render' | 'twitter' | 'email')[]
  publishedUrls: {target: string, url: string, publishedAt: timestamp}[]

  // Tracking
  lastActivity: timestamp
  completedAt?: timestamp
  archivedReason?: string
}

Artifact {
  id: string
  projectId: string
  type: 'draft' | 'code' | 'research_memo' | 'design'
  content: string
  generatedBy: 'human' | 'claude' | 'chatgpt' | 'perplexity' | string
  version: number
  status: 'draft' | 'ready' | 'published'
}
```

### 2. Capture Layer: Multiple Entry Points

**The goal: Zero friction to get ideas into the system.**

#### Capture Methods

1. **Chrome Extension / Bookmarklet**
   - Current tab URL + selected text + your note
   - One click → idea captured
   - Extension can have quick classify: "Is this content/code/research?"

2. **Email-to-Inbox**
   - Forward emails to `ideas@ultrathink.yourdomain`
   - Subject becomes title
   - Body becomes context
   - Links auto-extracted

3. **CLI Tool**
   ```bash
   ultrathink capture "Idea about AI coordination"
   ultrathink capture --url="..." --note="..."
   ```

4. **API Endpoint**
   - POST /api/projects
   - Any tool can push ideas in
   - Your voice memo app, Slack, wherever

5. **Browser Tab Scraper** (power move)
   - CLI command: `ultrathink ingest-tabs`
   - Scrapes all open Chrome tabs
   - Creates project for each with auto-summary
   - Closes tabs (optional flag)
   - Forces you to process, not hoard

#### Auto-Processing on Capture

When an idea comes in, Ultrathink runs:

1. **LLM Classifier** (your choice: Claude API, local model, whatever)
   - Type: content/code/research
   - Tags: extract keywords
   - Impact score: 1-5 based on your past shipping patterns
   - Effort: hours/days/weeks

2. **Deduplication Check**
   - Embedding similarity to existing projects
   - Flags: "This looks similar to Project #47"
   - You decide: merge or keep separate

3. **Auto-Brief Generation** (optional)
   - "Here's a 3-sentence brief for this idea..."
   - You edit or approve

**Result:** Captured ideas arrive in your backlog **already triaged**.

---

### 3. Brain Layer: Constraints & Prioritization

This is the **forcing function**. Ultrathink enforces your rules.

#### Constraint Engine

Define rules once:

```yaml
constraints:
  max_active_projects: 3
  min_shipped_per_week: 1
  stale_after_days: 14

  auto_archive:
    - condition: "stale AND effort='weeks'"
      action: archive
      reason: "Too big, too stale. Break it down or kill it."

  weekly_review:
    - day: Sunday
    - time: "18:00"
    - template: "review_prompt.md"
```

#### Daily Focus Algorithm

Every morning (or on demand):

```
Ultrathink analyzes:
- Projects in ACTIVE state
- Projects in REVIEW state (you need to ship these)
- Constraint violations (3+ active? Nothing shipped this week?)

Outputs:
  "TODAY'S FOCUS"

  🔴 MUST SHIP:
  - [Project #23: LinkedIn post on AI tools] → Move to SHIPPED

  🟡 MAKE PROGRESS:
  - [Project #15: Blog about orchestration] → Add 500 words

  🟢 IF TIME:
  - [Project #31: Research RAG architectures] → Start brief

  ⚠️  WARNINGS:
  - You have 4 active projects (max 3). Archive one or ship one.
  - No ships this week yet. Priority: ship something by EOD Friday.
```

You can override, but the system makes its expectations clear.

#### Priority Scoring

Auto-calculated:

```
priority = (impact_score * 10)
         + (days_since_capture * 0.5)
         - (effort_penalty)
         + (alignment_with_focus_areas)
```

You tweak the formula. System applies it.

---

### 4. Pipeline Layer: Pluggable Workflows

Instead of hardcoded "content agent → research agent → draft agent", think **workflows with your existing tools**.

#### Pipeline Architecture

```typescript
Pipeline {
  name: string
  trigger: 'manual' | 'auto_on_scope' | 'schedule'
  steps: Step[]
}

Step {
  name: string
  type: 'ai_prompt' | 'human_input' | 'api_call' | 'script'
  config: {
    // For AI prompts
    model?: 'claude' | 'gpt4' | 'perplexity'
    prompt?: string
    inputFrom?: 'project.brief' | 'artifact.content'
    outputTo?: 'create_artifact' | 'update_brief'

    // For scripts
    script?: string

    // For human input
    requestType?: 'approval' | 'input' | 'select'
  }
}
```

#### Example: Content Pipeline

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: "LinkedIn Post"
    trigger: manual
    steps:
      - name: "Research"
        type: ai_prompt
        config:
          model: perplexity  # Uses Perplexity API for research
          prompt: "Research this topic: {{project.brief}}. Find 5 key insights and supporting data."
          outputTo: create_artifact
          artifactType: research_memo

      - name: "Generate Draft"
        type: ai_prompt
        config:
          model: claude
          prompt: |
            Using this research: {{artifact.research_memo.content}}
            Write a LinkedIn post about: {{project.title}}

            Voice: {{user.voice_guidelines}}
            Format: Hook → Body → CTA
            Length: 150-200 words
          outputTo: create_artifact
          artifactType: draft

      - name: "Human Review"
        type: human_input
        config:
          requestType: approval
          message: "Review draft and approve or provide feedback"

      - name: "Publish"
        type: api_call
        config:
          service: linkedin_publisher
          action: create_draft
```

#### Example: Code/Experiment Pipeline

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: "Deploy to Render"
    trigger: manual
    steps:
      - name: "Generate Spec"
        type: ai_prompt
        config:
          model: claude
          prompt: "Turn this idea into a technical spec: {{project.brief}}"
          outputTo: create_artifact
          artifactType: spec

      - name: "Approve Spec"
        type: human_input
        config:
          requestType: approval

      - name: "Generate Code"
        type: ai_prompt
        config:
          model: claude
          prompt: "Implement this spec: {{artifact.spec.content}}. Generate a FastAPI app with a simple frontend."
          outputTo: create_artifact
          artifactType: code

      - name: "Create Repo"
        type: script
        config:
          script: "create_github_repo.sh"

      - name: "Deploy to Render"
        type: script
        config:
          script: "deploy_to_render.sh"

      - name: "Announce"
        type: ai_prompt
        config:
          model: claude
          prompt: "Write a LinkedIn post announcing this experiment: {{project.title}}. Include live URL: {{artifact.deployment.url}}"
          outputTo: create_artifact
          artifactType: announcement_draft
```

**Key Points:**
- Pipelines are YAML configs, not hardcoded
- You can use ANY AI tool (Claude, GPT-4, Perplexity, local models)
- You stay in the loop (human approval gates)
- Steps can be reordered, added, removed
- You can create new pipelines in 5 minutes

### 5. Publisher Layer: Multi-Destination Adapters

The "different publishing arms" you mentioned. Make this pluggable.

#### Publisher Interface

```typescript
interface Publisher {
  name: string
  publish(artifact: Artifact, config: PublishConfig): Promise<PublishResult>
}

PublishResult {
  success: boolean
  url?: string
  error?: string
}
```

#### Publisher Implementations

1. **LinkedIn Publisher**
   ```typescript
   // Option 1: Safe (via Buffer/Hypefury API)
   // Option 2: Direct (LinkedIn unofficial API - grey area)
   // Option 3: Draft mode (opens LinkedIn with prefilled text)

   publish(artifact) {
     // Post content to LinkedIn
     // Return URL of published post
   }
   ```

2. **Blog Publisher**
   ```typescript
   // Adapters for:
   // - Git-based markdown blog (commit + push)
   // - Ghost API
   // - WordPress API
   // - Medium API
   // - Substack API

   publish(artifact) {
     // Push to your blog
     // Trigger rebuild if static site
     // Return URL
   }
   ```

3. **Render Publisher**
   ```typescript
   publish(artifact) {
     // Create new Render service via API
     // Or deploy to existing service
     // Return live URL
   }
   ```

4. **Twitter Publisher**
   ```typescript
   publish(artifact) {
     // Thread support
     // Auto-split long content
   }
   ```

5. **Email/Newsletter Publisher**
   ```typescript
   // Adapters for:
   // - ConvertKit
   // - Mailchimp
   // - Beehiiv
   ```

#### Publishing Flow

```
You: "Ship this project"

Ultrathink:
  1. Checks publishTargets: ['linkedin', 'blog']
  2. For each target:
     - Finds appropriate artifact (draft, formatted version, etc.)
     - Calls publisher.publish()
     - Records published URL
  3. Moves project to SHIPPED status
  4. Updates your "shipped this week" count

You: "Show me what shipped"

Ultrathink:
  [Project #23: "AI Coordination Post"]
  - LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/posts/you/...
  - Blog: https://yourblog.com/ai-coordination
  - Published: 2 hours ago
```

---

### 6. Review Layer: Accountability Dashboard

You need feedback loops more than more input.

#### Dashboard Views

1. **Today View**
   - Daily focus (algorithm output)
   - Active projects (max 3)
   - Shipped this week count
   - Constraint violations

2. **Backlog View**
   - All CAPTURED projects
   - Sorted by priority score
   - Quick actions: Scope, Archive, Merge

3. **Active View**
   - All IN_PROGRESS projects
   - Days since last activity
   - Next action for each

4. **Shipped View**
   - All SHIPPED projects
   - Grouped by week/month
   - Published URLs
   - Analytics (if available)

5. **Analytics View**
   - Capture rate (ideas/week)
   - Ship rate (projects/week)
   - Conversion rate (captured → shipped)
   - Average time to ship
   - Most common tags/types
   - Stale project trends

#### Weekly Review Agent

Every Sunday:

```
Ultrathink generates:

# Weekly Review: Nov 15-21, 2025

## Shipped 🎉
- 3 LinkedIn posts
- 1 blog post
- 1 experiment deployed to Render

## In Progress
- [Project #15]: Blog on orchestration (active 6 days)
- [Project #22]: RAG research (active 3 days)

## Stale (14+ days)
- [Project #8]: Twitter bot idea
  Action needed: Kill, pause, or break into smaller scope?

## Captured This Week
- 12 new ideas

## Themes
You keep coming back to:
- AI coordination/orchestration (5 projects)
- Personal productivity tools (3 projects)
- Content about high-IQ workflows (4 projects)

Suggestion: These could be a content series or a bigger product.

## Next Week Focus
Recommended priorities:
1. Finish Blog #15 (high impact, almost done)
2. Ship or kill Project #8 (it's stale)
3. Start 1 project from "AI orchestration" cluster

Do you accept this focus? [Y/n]
```

## Tech Stack Recommendation

Since you can code this yourself, here's a practical stack:

### Backend
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node or Python (your choice)
- **Framework**:
  - Node: Fastify or Express
  - Python: FastAPI
- **Database**:
  - Start: SQLite (simple, file-based)
  - Scale: Postgres
- **ORM**: Prisma (Node) or SQLAlchemy (Python)

### Frontend
- **Framework**:
  - Quick & dirty: Plain HTML + Tailwind + Alpine.js
  - Modern: SvelteKit or Next.js
  - Your call: React if you're already fluent
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components

### AI Integration
- **Direct API calls**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity
- **Local models**: Ollama for privacy/cost
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI or local (for deduplication)

### Publishing
- **LinkedIn**: Use Buffer API or build direct integration
- **Blog**: Depends on your blog platform
- **Render**: Their API is straightforward
- **GitHub**: Octokit for repo creation/management

### Hosting
- **Backend**: Render, Railway, Fly.io
- **Database**: Render Postgres or Supabase
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, or same as backend

### Chrome Extension
- Manifest V3
- Simple form → POST to your API

---

## MVP: Build This First

Don't build the whole system. Build the **minimum viable forcing function**.

### MVP Scope (Week 1)

#### Core Features
1. **Capture**
   - Simple web form
   - Chrome bookmarklet
   - API endpoint

2. **Backlog**
   - List of captured projects
   - Manual classification (type, impact, effort)
   - Manual prioritization

3. **State Management**
   - Move projects through states manually
   - Display current state clearly

4. **Constraints**
   - Hard limit: 3 active projects
   - Warning if no ships this week

5. **One Pipeline**
   - "LinkedIn Post" pipeline
   - Research step (manual: paste in research)
   - Draft step (call Claude API with your voice rules)
   - Approve step (you edit/approve)
   - Publish step (copy to clipboard or draft in Buffer)

6. **Simple Dashboard**
   - Today view: Active projects + focus
   - Backlog view: Captured ideas sorted by priority

### What's NOT in MVP
- ❌ Auto-classification AI
- ❌ Deduplication
- ❌ Multiple pipelines
- ❌ Direct LinkedIn posting
- ❌ Weekly review agent
- ❌ Analytics
- ❌ Browser tab scraper
- ❌ Email-to-inbox

### MVP Success Criteria

After 1 week of use:
- You've captured 10+ ideas (not in tabs)
- You've shipped 2+ projects that would have stayed in "tab limbo"
- You feel the forcing function working

If those are true, add more features.

---

## Build Sequence (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2: Automation
- Auto-classification on capture
- Multiple pipeline templates
- Better AI integration (research agents, etc.)

### Phase 3: Publishing
- Direct LinkedIn posting
- Blog integration
- Render deployment automation

### Phase 4: Intelligence
- Deduplication
- Weekly review agent
- Priority score tuning
- Analytics dashboard

### Phase 5: Scale
- Browser tab scraper
- Email-to-inbox
- Mobile capture (PWA or native)
- Collaboration (if you ever want to share with a team)

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Pluggable AI Backends
Don't lock yourself into one LLM. Use an adapter pattern:

```typescript
interface LLMProvider {
  complete(prompt: string, config: LLMConfig): Promise<string>
}

// Implementations: ClaudeProvider, GPTProvider, PerplexityProvider, OllamaProvider
```

You can switch providers per pipeline step.

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop by Default
Never let AI fully automate publishing. Always have approval gates. Trust is earned.

### 3. Data Portability
All project data in simple JSON/markdown. You can:
- Export everything
- Backup to Git
- Switch to a different system if needed

### 4. API-First Design
Build the API first. Frontend is just a client. Later you can:
- Add mobile app
- Add CLI
- Add Slack bot
- Let other tools integrate

---

## Why This Will Work for You

### 1. It's Simple Enough to Build
- MVP: 3-5 days of focused coding
- Core system: 2-3 weeks
- You're high IQ and can code. This is doable.

### 2. It Works WITH Your Tools
- Not replacing your AI tools
- Orchestrating them
- You keep using Claude, GPT, Perplexity, whatever

### 3. It Forces Completion
- Constraint engine prevents infinite WIP
- Daily focus algorithm
- Metrics showing capture:ship ratio

### 4. It's Flexible
- Pipelines are configs, not code
- Publishers are adapters
- You can add new publishing destinations anytime

### 5. It Matches Your Workflow
- Capture ideas fast (you generate lots)
- Triage automatically (you're high IQ, system filters noise)
- Ship to multiple places (LinkedIn, blog, Render)
- Force decisions (you need this)

---

## Naming & Positioning

**Ultrathink** is a great name. It implies:
- Beyond normal thinking
- High-powered cognition
- A tool for people with intense mental output

Positioning: "Personal AI orchestration layer for high-output creators"

Tagline ideas:
- "Stop collecting ideas. Start shipping."
- "Git for your creative output"
- "The forcing function you need"
- "Turn tabs into shipped work"

---

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### 1. Privacy & Data
- Host your own backend? (Full control)
- Or use managed services? (Faster setup)
- Where does AI processing happen? (APIs vs local models)

### 2. LinkedIn Publishing
- Safe mode (Buffer/Hypefury)?
- Direct mode (grey area)?
- Draft mode (you paste into LinkedIn)?

### 3. Initial Publishing Targets
What are your actual publishing destinations?
- LinkedIn (confirmed)
- Blog (which platform?)
- Render (for apps)
- Twitter?
- Email newsletter?
- Others?

### 4. Voice/Style Guidelines
For AI to draft in your voice, need:
- Example posts you like
- Tone guidelines
- Format preferences
- Topics you care about

### 5. Existing AI Tools
Which AI tools are you currently using that we should integrate?
- Claude, GPT-4, Perplexity (obvious)
- Code generation: GitHub Copilot, Cursor?
- Research: Elicit, Consensus?
- Content: Jasper, Copy.ai?
- Others?

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. **Decide on MVP scope**
   - Agree on the Week 1 feature set above?
   - Or adjust based on your priorities?

2. **Choose tech stack**
   - Backend: Node/TypeScript or Python/FastAPI?
   - Frontend: Simple HTML or modern framework?
   - Database: SQLite to start?

3. **Define data models**
   - Project schema
   - Artifact schema
   - Pipeline config format

### Week 1: Build MVP
1. Set up backend + database
2. Create basic API (capture, list, update state)
3. Simple frontend (backlog view, project detail)
4. One pipeline: LinkedIn post draft
5. Chrome bookmarklet for capture

### Week 2: Use It
1. Actually use Ultrathink for 1 week
2. Capture real ideas
3. Run real pipeline
4. Ship real posts
5. Note what's frustrating

### Week 3: Iterate
1. Fix pain points from Week 2
2. Add 1-2 most needed features
3. Start building Phase 2

---

## Final Thought

The other AI gave you a comprehensive vision. But visions don't ship code.

You need to build the **smallest thing that changes your behavior**.

For you, that's:
1. A place to dump ideas (so you close tabs)
2. A forcing function (so you ship, not just start)
3. A publishing layer (so finishing actually means "live on internet")

Build that. Use it. Then add the clever stuff.

The goal isn't the perfect system. The goal is: **one month from now, you've shipped 10 projects that would have died in tab limbo**.

That's success.
